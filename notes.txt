- TODO: add support for masks in find.image and find.images
- i found a weird bug where Image.__init__ undid changes to the data
	being passed to it.  using ndarray.view(Image) was the solution
- i should rework ACA (acagui.py) because its messy and doesnt work great

- couldnt get masks to work with cv2 image finding, removed
- added original image finding fn back as image_exact
	very slow but supporting masks was easy
- need a text drawing function
- gave pa2d.filtersize a proper implementation

8/28/20
- added more convenience to circle and box types
- changed minimap and compass back to circles
- made core/fonts use absolute path
	dont use relative paths for non-python files
	maybe dont use relative paths at all...
- added util file with text/image drawing
- add transparent channel masks for cv2 image finding?
	at least try it ...
