- TODO: add support for masks in find.image and find.images
- i found a weird bug where Image.__init__ undid changes to the data
	being passed to it.  using ndarray.view(Image) was the solution
- i should rework ACA (acagui.py) because its messy and doesnt work great

- couldnt get masks to work with cv2 image finding, removed
- added original image finding fn back as image_exact
	very slow but supporting masks was easy
- need a text drawing function
- gave pa2d.filtersize a proper implementation
